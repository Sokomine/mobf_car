This adds a car as a "mob" for Minetest. The model was done by Melkor. The "mob" needs mobf from Sapier in order to run!

Depends on: mobf, animalmaterials.

Beware: Cars are "living" entities here! They spawn in the wild, they move randomly, and they even jump!

To "tame" a car, catch it with a lasso.

To "ride" a car, left-click it while wielding a saddle.


This is more a proof of concept and fun to play with.

Code: The little there is - WTFPL. Please note that most of it is a sample from mobf that's just reconfigured! So pay attention to the mobf liscense as well.
